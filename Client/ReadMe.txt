The website is designed to be simple and easy for the user to use.

the login/signup button both alternate so that we do not need two web pages.
once the button is pressed, a global variable is globally redefined so that we can determine whether we are gathering information for checking or just plainly sending information.

To run the webpage, just go to SignUp.html, and that is where you will find that webpage.

hangman Game 

Similar to the other games, the webpage was made interactive with the user, so that they feel they can affect certain aspects of the website.

to solve the problem of displaying the correct letters at the correct positions, i made sure to create a for loop that goes through each element of the string, then store both the letter used,
and where it was used, removing the space and assigning new words to them.

to run it, run a live server on hangman.html
